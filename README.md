Jersey is a REST framework that provides JAX-RS Reference Implementation and more.
Jersey provides its own [APIs][jersey-api] that extend the JAX-RS toolkit with
additional features and utilities to further simplify RESTful service and client
development. Jersey also exposes numerous extension SPIs so that developers may
extend Jersey to best suit their needs.

Goals of Jersey project can be summarized in the following points:

- Track the JAX-RS API and provide regular releases of production quality
  Reference Implementations that ships with GlassFish;
- Provide APIs to extend Jersey & Build a community of users and developers;
  and finally
- Make it easy to build RESTful Web services utilising Java and the
  Java Virtual Machine.
